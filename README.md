# Dam Campus
An interactive campus map and social networking fusion website made for the 2024 Web.Lab competition at MIT.

With an engaging 2D game component created with HTML Canvas, Dam Campus elevates the exploration of MIT's extensive campus, allowing users to travel across a digitally-rendered map in the form of a hand-drawn beaver avatar with various customization options. Carefully placed within each building is a distinctive red button serving as a portal its corresponding social media feed that opens in a new tab. This provides a platform for students to share their building-specific fun facts and personal experience, which not only enriches the campus exploration experience for prospective and future students, but also acts as a vibrant storytelling space for existing students, promoting a deeper connection with campus culture.
